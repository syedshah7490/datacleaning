This project analyzes a car dataset provided in CSV format, containing 432 rows and 15 columns, offering insights into various car attributes. The main focus is on handling missing values, performing statistical analysis, and building predictive models for car-related predictions (e.g., price predictions, classification of car types). The dataset includes information such as car make, model, year, mileage, and price.

Key Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values using .fillna())
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the data
Statistical analysis and summary statistics using .describe()
Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms (if applicable)
